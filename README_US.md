# Agno RAG Agent

**Agno RAG Agent** is a chat application that combines models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
It allows users to ask questions based on Agno's knowledge base, documents, and web data, retrieve context-aware answers, and maintain chat history across sessions.
This application, whose source code is provided along with Agno, was used to practically demonstrate the construction of knowledge bases
based on source code. (See article: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/otimizando-o-tamanho-de-chunk-em-rag-para-bases-sistemas-glauber-duma-xf1tf)
In the `agentic_rag.py` script, I made some adjustments to build our knowledge base on top of the source code.
I chose to use SqliteStorage and ChromaDb for their simplicity and zero cost, but you are free to use other technologies.
I used `text-embedding-3-small` as the embedder, but you can use other embedders as well.
I suggest you run tests, experiment freely, and see what gives the best results.
